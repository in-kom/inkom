## Project Definition

Today, with the omnipresence of social networks in professional marketing, these platforms have become essential for business development and client acquisition. However, companies, especially small ones, often lack the time or resources to dedicate to this time-consuming task. Inkom aims to facilitate this process, enabling professionals to create impactful and high-quality content without expending significant resources or needing specialized communication skills.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a marketable product that enables professionals to create high-quality social media content easily.
- Ensure the product is technically challenging and demonstrates advanced knowledge and skills.
- Achieve a successful graduation by meeting all academic and project requirements.

## Scope Statement

### In-Scope:
- Development of a software application englobing social media content production value chain.
- Delivery of supporting documentation (Functional Specification, Technical Specification, Test Plan, User Manual).
- Marketing and sales strategies post-development.

### Out-of-Scope:
- Advanced AI features beyond the initial proprietary AI API.

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions:
- All necessary resources (software, hardware, access to stakeholders) will be available.
- The student will have sufficient time to dedicate to the project alongside academic responsibilities.

### Constraints:
- The project must be completed within a 6-month timeframe.
- The project has a zero-budget constraint.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Risks:
- **Time Management:** Balancing project work with academic responsibilities.
- **Technical Challenges:** Encountering unforeseen technical difficulties.
- **Resource Limitations:** Limited access to necessary tools or expertise.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Time Management:** Create a detailed schedule and adhere to it strictly.
- **Technical Challenges:** Seek guidance from mentors and utilize online resources.
- **Resource Limitations:** Leverage free or open-source tools and seek peer support.

## Stakeholders

| Role            | Representative           | Expectation                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Student         | Antoine PREVOST (Inkom)  | Develop a marketable product and graduate successfully.                                                        |
| Graduation Jury | Franck JEANNIN (ALGOSUP) | Receive a technically challenging software solution that demonstrates the knowledge of the graduating student. |

## Project Plan

Given that this project does not have a fixed timeframe, and to ensure timely market delivery, I will use SCRUM methodologies. This approach starts with developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and iteratively improving it by adding new functionalities and fixing bugs in subsequent versions.

The project planning will involve defining the application's tasks and objectives, guided by the roadmap created with the French Tech Tremplin Prépa program and CCIs. To establish this roadmap and track performance and achievements over time, I will use appropriate project management tools.

## Milestones

The milestones listed below focus on delivering the prototype version. As mentioned in the [Project Plan](#project-plan), these deliverables will undergo an iterative process with continuous updates.

| Date       | Milestone                                |

| 08/10/2024 | Functional specification delivery        |
| 08/20/2024 | Technical specification delivery         |
| 09/01/2024 | Test plan delivery                       |
| 11/01/2024 | Working prototype without proprietary AI |
| 11/01/2024 | User Manual delivery                     |
| 02/01/2025 | Proprietary AI API                       |

## Deliverables

The primary deliverable is the source code of the application. Additionally, to ensure thorough evaluation by the graduation jury, the following documents will be submitted at the project's conclusion:

- Functional Specification
- Technical Specification
- Test Plan
- User Manual
- Management Planning & Monthly Reports

Furthermore, a 40-minute presentation of the project will be conducted in front of the graduation jury twice at the end of my cursus.

## Quality Management

Quality will be managed through regular code reviews, adherence to best practices in software development, and thorough testing as outlined in the Test Plan. Feedback from the graduation jury and other stakeholders will be incorporated to ensure the product meets high standards.

## Communication Plan

- **Weekly Updates:** A brief progress report will be sent to the graduation jury and any other relevant stakeholders.
- **Monthly Meetings:** Detailed progress meetings will be held with mentors and advisors.
- **Ad-Hoc Communications:** As needed, communication will be maintained via email or other suitable channels.

## Approval and Review

The project charter will be reviewed and approved by the graduation jury at the start of the project. Subsequent major deliverables will also undergo review and approval to ensure alignment with project goals and academic requirements.

## Allocated Resources

- **Budget:** 0€
- **Workforce:** 1 person (Antoine PREVOST)
- **Worktime:** 6 months/26 weeks, averaging 30 hours per week
- **Total estimated human hours:** 780 hours
