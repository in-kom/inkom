## Project Definition

As today, with the omnipresenece of social networks in marketing for professionals, it became a key part in business development and clients acquiring proceses. However, companies, and particularly small ones do not always have the time or the available resources to dedicate energy to this time-consuming task. Inkom comes as a facilitator, enhancing creativity for professionals who can create impactful and high-quality content without having to spend a lot of resources or having skills in the field of communication.
